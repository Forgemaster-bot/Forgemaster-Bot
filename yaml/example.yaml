# How I forsee this yaml file working:
#
# Categories: Contain list of items which can be made. Each category gets turned into a menu option 'Create a <category> item'. 
#   I.e. 'thaumstyn ' turns into 'Create a thaumstyn item'
# 
# Items: When player goes into a menu, each item's costs will be checked and if the player can meet the costs it will get turned into a menu option '<label>'.
# 
# When a player selects an item do the following: 
#   1. Check that player can meet the costs by checking that character.has_item_quantity(item, quantity). 'stop' if check is failed.
#   2. Determine pre-requisites based on type:
#       - dc: dc check is performed using field 'dc'. recipe['dc']['check'] is number to meet. recipe['dc']['mod'] is the modifier to roll.
#   3. List costs.
#   4. List pre-requisites to meet *after consuming the costs*.
#   5. Query player to confirm their choice.
#   6. Remove costs from player and update their inventory.
#   7. Perform pre-requisite check. 'stop' if check is failed.
#       - dc: Roll d20, add modifier, and return comparision to check.
#   8. If outcomes exist, get random value from list. Set item name to prefix + ' ' + outcome.
#   9. Add item name to players inventory and update.
